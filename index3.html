				<h1>Cupcake</h1>
				<p>A cupcake is a small cake designed to serve one person, which may be baked in a small thin paper or aluminum cup. As with larger cakes, icing and other cake decorations such as fruit and candy may be applied. A standard cupcake uses the same basic ingredients as standard-sized cakes: butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. Nearly any recipe that is suitable for a layer cake can be used to bake cupcakes. The cake batter used for cupcakes may be flavored or have other ingredients stirred in, such as raisins, berries, nuts, or chocolate chips.</p>
				<p>Our pastry shop offers different flavors of cupcake like:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Strawberry</li>
					<li>Mango</li>
					<li>Chocolate</li>
					<li>Mocha</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>Pie</h1>
				<p>A pie is a baked dish which is usually made of a pastry dough casing that covers or completely contains a filling of various sweet or savoury ingredients.Pies are defined by their crusts. A filled pie (also single-crust or bottom-crust), has pastry lining the baking dish, and the filling is placed on top of the pastry but left open. A top-crust pie has the filling in the bottom of the dish and is covered with a pastry or other covering before baking. A two-crust pie has the filling completely enclosed in the pastry shell. Shortcrust pastry is a typical kind of pastry used for pie crusts, but many things can be used, including baking powder biscuits, mashed potatoes, and crumbs..</p>
				<p>Our pastry shop offers different kinds of pie like:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Apple pie</li>
					<li>Mango pie</li>
					<li>Cherry pie</li>
					<li>Blue berry pie</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>Profiterole</h1>
				<p>A profiterole, cream puff, or chou à la crème is a filled French choux pastry ball with a typically sweet and moist filling of whipped cream, custard, pastry cream, or ice cream. The puffs may be decorated or left plain or garnished with chocolate sauce, caramel, or a dusting of powdered sugar. Savory profiterole are also made, filled with pureed meats, cheese, and so on. These were formerly common garnishes for soups.</p>
				<p>Our pastry shop offers profiteroles with different fillings like:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Strawberry jam</li>
