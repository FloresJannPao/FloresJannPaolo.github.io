				<h1>Buchi</h1>
				<p>Buchi is a type of fried Chinese pastry made from glutinous rice flour. The pastry is coated with sesame seeds on the outside and is crisp and chewy. Inside the pastry is a large hollow, caused by the expansion of the dough. The hollow of the pastry is filled with a filling usually consisting of lotus paste, or alternatively sweet black bean paste, or less commonly red bean paste. They are also sometimes referred to as sesame balls.</p>
				<p>Our pastry shop offers different buchis with different fillings like:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Red bean paste</li>
					<li>Sweet black bean paste</li>
					<li>Cheese</li>
					<li>Matcha paste</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>Churros</h1>
				<p>A churros is a fried-dough pastry predominantly choux based snack. Churros are traditional in Spain and Portugal, from where they originate, as well as the Philippines and Ibero-America. They are also consumed in the Southwestern United States, France and other areas that have received immigration from Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries. In Spain, churros can either be thin (and sometimes knotted) or long and thick, where they are known as porras in some regions. They are normally eaten for breakfast dipped in champurrado, hot chocolate, dulce de leche or caf√© con leche. Sugar is often sprinkled on top.</p>

				<h1>Turon</h1>
				<p>Turon also known as lumpiyang saging (Filipino for "banana lumpia"), is a Philippine snack made of thinly sliced bananas (preferably saba or Cardaba bananas) and a slice of jackfruit, dusted with brown sugar, rolled in a spring roll wrapper and fried. Other fillings can also be used, including sweet potato, mango, cheddar cheese and coconut. Turon is a popular snack and street food amongst Filipinos. These are usually sold along streets with banana cue, camote cue, and maruya.</p>
